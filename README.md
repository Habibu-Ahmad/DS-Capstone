# ðŸš€ Applied Data Science Capstone  

This project is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It serves as a culmination of all the concepts and skills learned throughout the specialization, applying them to a real-world problem in the form of a data-driven project.  

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview  

SpaceX has revolutionized the commercial space industry by significantly reducing launch costs, primarily by reusing the first stage of its Falcon 9 rockets. A single launch costs $62 million, compared to over $165 million from other providers. Predicting whether the first stage will successfully land is crucial for estimating the cost-effectiveness of future launches.  

In this project, we use publicly available data and machine learning models to predict whether SpaceX will successfully reuse the first stage.  

## ðŸ“„ Key Questions  

- How do factors like payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbit type influence first-stage landing success?  
- Has the success rate of landings improved over the years?  
- Which classification algorithm performs best in predicting first-stage reuse?  

## ðŸ“„ Methodology  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Retrieved data using SpaceX's REST API  
   - Scraped launch details from Wikipedia  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Filtered and cleaned the data  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Applied One-Hot Encoding for binary classification  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Conducted visual analysis using Python libraries  
   - Queried structured data using SQL  

4. **Interactive Visual Analytics**  
   - Created geospatial visualizations with Folium  
   - Developed interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash  

5. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Built and fine-tuned classification models  
   - Evaluated models to identify the best-performing approach  

This project combines data science techniques, machine learning, and interactive visual analytics to provide insights into SpaceX's launch success. ðŸš€
